# RPG-Example
Example of an simple RPG written in C#. 

Simple way to create an easy expandable RPG-Game in C# without any third-party-framework. 
It is very similar to a text-based-adventure with very minimalistic controls( Go North/South/West/East,attack,use potion for example).
There are a few areas to walk to, 2 quests,a few different enemies, a few different weapons, simple level up system and a XML-based savesystem.
NOTE : Walking to a new area will refill your HP.
